# Handi-Talky Commander PWA

This is a mini, web-based version of [Handi-Talky Commander](https://github.com/Ylianst/HTCommander). It's build as a Progressive Web App (PWA) and so, should work on all major OS's (Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, iOS), however, it all depends on how well the OS supports PWA's.

This is a very early version and does not currently do anything useful. It's in development.

You can give it a try at: [https://ylianst.github.io/HTCommanderWeb/](https://ylianst.github.io/HTCommanderWeb/). If you load the page using Chrome or Edge, you should see an extra icon on the URL bar to create a desktop icon for this web page. When run using the desktop icon, the app will run offline (no Internet required) and will run somewhat like a native application. On Android, you need to add a desktop icon for the page and it will run much like a native Android app.

Once running, you can hit "Connect" to have the app communicate with the radio. You may need to put the radio in pairing mode before selecting it in the paring dialog box.

This version will likely never support audio or text-to-speech, but should support configuring channels, APRS, Terminal, etc. Winlink is possible but your be a lot of work.
